# express-typescript-sequelize-starter
A nodejs server application starter set up with typescript and sequelize-typescript.  
.vscode folder is included for a faster startup speed with your next project.

Duplicate `example.env`, rename to `.env` and then fill the values appropriately.
Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
Run the project using `npm run watch` or simply `node www`.

I will keep this up to date as much as I can. Make a new issue in this repo if something is outdated and I will update it ASAP :)
